**DFox** is a Rust-based database management tool that provides a terminal user interface (TUI) for interacting with PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
It allows users to perform database operations easily and efficiently through a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- Connect to multiple database types: PostgreSQL, MySQL, (SQLite still in development).
- User-friendly terminal interface for managing database connections and performing CRUD operations.
- Dynamic rendering of database schemas and table data.
- Easily extendable for additional database types and features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a Cargo workspace consisting of two main components:

- **dfox-core**: The core library responsible for database operations. It includes implementations for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite clients, as well as data models and error handling.
- **dfox-tui**: The command-line interface for user interaction. It contains the main functions for launching the application, along with UI components and event handlers.

## How It Works

1. **Database Type Selection**  
   Upon starting the application, the user is presented with a menu to select the database type (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite). Use the up/down keys to navigate and Enter to confirm your choice.

2. **Connection Input Screen**  
   After selecting the database type, the user is prompted to input the connection details such as hostname, port, username, and password.

3. **Database Selection**  
   Once connected, a list of available databases is displayed. The user can choose the database to interact with.

4. **Table View**  
   The application dynamically renders the list of tables available in the selected database.

5. **Describe Table**  
   The user can select a table to view its schema, displayed in a tree-like structure, including column names, types, and constraints.

6. **Query Execution and Results**  
   The user can execute SQL queries and view the results in the TUI.

7. **Error Handling**  
   If there is an error with the query or database operation, an error message is displayed in the interface.

```

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the TUI application with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin dfox-tui
```
